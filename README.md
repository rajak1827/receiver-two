**The OTP Receiver Bot is a Telegram bot designed to receive Telegram accounts from users, verify them, and provide monetary compensation. This bot allows users to submit their accounts, manage their balance, and withdraw funds.**

## Features

- **Account Submission**: Users can submit their Telegram accounts with phone numbers
- **Account Verification**: The bot verifies submitted accounts automatically

## How It Works

1. User submits a phone number through the bot

3. Account is verified for quality (checks for scam marks, frozen status, spam limitations)
4. If the account meets requirements, the user receives payment
5. Users can withdraw their earnings through various payment methods
